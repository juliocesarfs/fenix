## :speech_balloon: About
The FÃªnix project is a platform where its main objective is the connection between students and teachers.

A free platform, aiming at free knowledge and valuing teachers who want to make classes available to other students registered on the platform.

Where both (teacher and student) are totally free within the platform, our only goal is to connect them.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for my personal study.

## :love_letter: Motivation
Our biggest motivation is in relation to Covid-19, with schools closed, teachers and students at home, the idea came up to create a completely online platform where teachers can exercise their occupation at home.
